# Python-Fundamentals_1
This is my first repository about Python. As you can see from this file, I've started to learn Python by learning operators, some important methods (type(),print(), range() etc), data types and their methods and some important keywords (for in, def etc). 

Unlike other programming languages, Python doesn't need a type specification in variable assignment so a variable can take different types of values.

We can assign an integer to a variable then we can assign a string to the same variable. I think this is the best feature that Python has.

Note: I will continue adding my other files about Python Pandas (files about EDA, Unsupervised Learning, Supervised Learning) as well as my course project files about Excel, SQL, Python, PowerBI later
