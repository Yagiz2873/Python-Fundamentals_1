# Python-Fundamentals_1
This is my first repository about Python. As you can see from this file, I've started to learn Python by learning operators, some important methods (type(),print(), range() etc), data types and their methods and some important keywords (for in, def etc). 

Unlike other programming languages, Python doesn't need a type specification in variable assignment so a variable can take different types of values.

We can assign an integer to a variable then we can assign a string to the same variable. I think this is the best feature that Python has.

In Python we can make scopes happen by indentation, so we should take it this rule into consideration when writing

Note: I will continue adding my other files about Python Pandas (files about EDA, Unsupervised Learning, Supervised Learning and some of its algorithms) as well as my course project files about Excel, SQL, Python, PowerBI later. This project was a group project so, I am gonna show you some parts of the project that I've worked with.
